title: "Predicting Perceived Music Emotions with Respect to Instrument Combinations"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-music-emotion
excerpt: 'We compare the accuracy difference between music emotion recognition models given music pieces as a whole versus music pieces separated by instruments. We provide empirical evidence that training Random Forest and Convolution Recurrent Neural Network with mixed instrumental music data conveys a better understanding of emotion than training the same models with music that are separated into each instrumental source'
